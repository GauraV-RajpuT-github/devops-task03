# DevOps Git Project

## Objective
Manage a DevOps project using Git best practices including branching, tagging, and documentation.

## Branching Strategy
- `main`: Stable production-ready code
- `dev`: Integration branch for development
- `feature/*`: Feature-specific branches

## Git Features Used
- Commit history for traceability
- Branching and merging via pull requests
- Tags for version control
- .gitignore to avoid committing unnecessary files
- Markdown documentation

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Switch to `dev` or create a `feature` branch
3. Develop, commit, push, and raise a pull request
